## Product FAQ

### What is PALM?

PALM is a comprehensive AI productivity platform that combines a prompt library, chat interface, automated agentic workflows, and advanced AI model experimentation tools to increase productivity and streamline workflows at every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The platform empowers users to leverage AI through multiple pathways: engaging with specialized prompts optimized for large language models, conducting natural conversations with AI assistants, executing multi-step automated workflows, and comparing responses across different AI providers.

PALM's capabilities span the full spectrum of development needs, from generating JIRA user stories and technical documentation to feature prototyping, documentation, and end-to-end process automation through configurable AI agents.

## What is the purpose of the tool?

PALM's goal is streamline workflows, automate tasks, and enhance individual productivity.

### How is the application used?

There are five main paths a user could take while using PALM: Chat, Prompt Library, Prompt Generator, Prompt Playground, and Agents.

The **Chat** interface allows users to converse with LLMs, incorporate knowledge base resources into the chat context, and generate documents and code artifacts.

The **Prompt Library** hosts predefined prompts and users' customized prompts.

The **Prompt Generator** allows users to build their own prompt "from scratch", starting with instruction generation, fine-tuning, and ultimately saving the prompt.

The **Prompt Playground** allows users to compare and fine-tune responses from multiple large language models (LLM) providers (ChatGPT, Meta Llama, Google Bard).

The **Agents** interface provides access to configurable, use-case specific agentic workflows that automate complex multi-step processes. Users can select from various pre-built agent workflows tailored to specific development scenarios and configure them according to their needs.

### What's the roadmap for PALM?

PALM continues to evolve with enhanced workflow capabilities and expanded AI model integration. Future developments include expanding the library of available agentic workflows, improving workflow customization options, and incorporating additional AI model providers to give users more choice and flexibility in their AI-powered development processes.

## Technical FAQ

### What underlying technology does PALM use?

PALM is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) application built using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The frontend component of the project uses [React](https://react.dev/) and [Mantine](https://v6.mantine.dev/) for the component library, while the backend uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for the database.
