# ADR <N>: <Brief Decision Title in Title-Case>
<!-- Replace the <N> and <Brief Decision Title in Title-Case> with the next number and a short title that describes the decision; then remove this comment -->

## Context
Describe the forces at play, including technological, political,
social, and project local. These forces are likely in tension, and should be called
out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing
facts. Rationale should be self-evident from the context

## Decision
This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences,
with active voice. "We will ...â€œ
Example: The following design patterns are proposed for adoption by the Azure SDK team. They are arranged in alphabetical order.

## Status
Choose one: *Proposed* | *Accepted* | *Rejected* | *Deprecated* | *Superseded*

Until a conclusion is reached, the status should be *Proposed*.
When the conclusion is ready for wider consumption, the status should be *Accepted*. A *Rejected* ADR is still valuable. It can help prevent people from bikeshedding the same topic again and again, wasting time of future team members.

Later a status may be changed to *Deprecated* or *Superseded*.
If *Deprecated*, include a rationale.
If *Superseded*, include a link to the new ADR

## Consequences
Describe the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should
be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive,
negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the
future.

(Optional) Breakup the list of consequences into subsections like "Positive Consequences" and "Negative Consequences".

## References

## Alternatives (optional)
A list of alternatives that were considered but not chosen

## Appendix (optional)
Additional information that supplements the main document. Broken down into subheadings as needed.
