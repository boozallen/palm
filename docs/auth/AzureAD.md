# Configuring AzureAD

Azure Active Directory (AzureAD) is Microsoft's comprehensive Identity and Access Management solution, offering robust reliability and scalability for securing applications and services across on-premises, cloud, or hybrid environments.

## ENVIRONMENT: Local, Production

To integrate AzureAD authentication within your application, follow the steps outlined below. These steps are applicable for both local development and production environments.

1. **Provision Your Instance of Azure AD:** Begin by provisioning and configuring your Azure AD instance. This process includes registering your application, setting up authentication parameters, and configuring single sign-on (SSO) capabilities according to your organization's requirements.
2. **Configure Environment Variables:** Ensure that the AzureAD credentials – `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID` – are correctly configured in your environment file (`.env.local` for local development). These credentials are essential for the authentication process, enabling your application to communicate securely with AzureAD services.
    - `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID`: The unique identifier for your registered AzureAD application.
    - `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET`: A confidential secret key generated by AzureAD, used to authenticate your application.
    - `AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID`: The unique identifier of your AzureAD tenant.
